# frame work of cyber security
*Improving critical infrastructure
it is the policy of the United states to enhance the security  of the nation's critical infrastructure and to maintain a
cyber enviroment that provide efficiency innovationand economics prosperity while promoting safety security privacy and civil liberties
* * according to executive order
* alligns buisness and technological approach to address cyber attacks
* identify area for improvement to be address
* be consistant with voluntary international standards
* * why we need cyber security framework
Cyber security frameworks help teams to address cyber security challenges, providing a strategic,well-thought plan to protect its data, infrastructure
, and information systems. The frameworks offer guidance, helping IT security leaders manage their organization's cyber risks more intelligently.
* * What Are the Types of Cyber Security Frameworks?
Frameworks break down into three types based on the needed function.
* Control Frameworks
Develops a basic strategy for the organization’s cyber security department
Provides a baseline group of security controls
Assesses the present state of the infrastructure and technology
Prioritizes implementation of security controls
* Program Frameworks
Assesses the current state of the organization’s security program
Constructs a complete cybersecurity program
Measures the program’s security and competitive analysis
Facilitates and simplifies communications between the cyber security team and the managers/executives
* Risk Frameworks
Defines the necessary processes for risk assessment and management
Structures a security program for risk management
Identifies, measures, and quantifies the organization’s security risks
Prioritizes appropriate security measures and activities
* * Top Cyber Security Frameworks
* * The NIST Cyber Security Framework.
it was established during the Obama Administration in response to presidential Executive Order 13636. The NIST was designed to protect America’s
critical infrastructure (e.g., dams, power plants) from cyberattacks.
* There are five functions  associated with NIST
Identify
Protect
Detect
Respond
Recover
* * The Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls (CIS).
This framework was developed in the late 2000s to protect companies from cyber threats. It’s made up of 20 controls regularly 
updated by security professionals from many fields (academia, government, industrial)
* * The International Standards Organization (ISO) frameworks ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002.
This framework is also called ISO 270K. It is considered the internationally recognized cyber security validation standard 
for both internal situations and across third parties.
* * The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Better known as HIPAA, it provides a framework for managing confidential patient and consumer data, particularly privacy issues. 
This legislation protects electronic healthcare information and is essential for healthcare providers
* * objective of cyber security frame work
Their are 5 objective of cyber security frame work
1 :Adoptable
2 :improve organization readiness for managing cyber security risk
3:flexible repeatable and performance based
4:cost effective
5:promote technology inovation
6:actionable across the enterprise
* *cyber security framework components
The Cybersecurity Framework consists of three main components:
1:the Core, 
The Framework Core provides a set of desired cybersecurity activities and outcomes using common language that is easy to understand.
2:Implementation Tiers, 
The Framework Implementation Tiers assist organizations by providing context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk management.
3:Profiles.
Framework Profiles are an organization’s unique alignment of their organizational requirements and objectives, risk appetite, and resources against the desired outcomes of the Framework Core. 
* * framework core identity
What does the core identity include?
 Core Identity: Is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality. 
Manages users, passwords, profile data, roles, claims, tokens, email confirmation, and more.
* framework profiles protect
 the Framework Profile (“Profile”) is the alignment of the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories 
 with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization.
 * framework profiles respond
  Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
  * framework profiles recover
  “develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to
  restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cyber security event.
